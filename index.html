		<div class='content'>What do I do if I accidentally use the wrong commit type?
			When you used a type that’s of the spec but not the correct type, e.g. fix instead of feat
			Prior to merging or releasing the mistake, we recommend using git rebase -i to edit the commit history. After release, the cleanup will be different according to what tools and processes you use.

			When you used a type not of the spec, e.g. feet instead of feat
			In a worst case scenario, it’s not the end of the world if a commit lands that does not meet the conventional commit specification. It simply means that commit will be missed by tools that are based on the spec.

			Do all my contributors need to use the conventional commit specification?
			No! If you use a squash based workflow on Git lead maintainers can cleanup the commit messages as they’re merged—adding no workload to casual committers. A common workflow for this is to have your git system automatically squash commits from a pull request and present a form for the lead maintainer to enter the proper git commit message for the merge.

			About
			The Conventional Commit specification is inspired by, and based heavily on, the Angular Commit Guidelines.

			The first draft of this specification has been written in collaboration with some of the folks contributing to:

			conventional-changelog: a set of tools for parsing conventional commit messages from git histories.
			unleash: a tool for automating the software release and publishing lifecycle.
			lerna: a tool for managing monorepos, which grew out of the Babel project.
			Projects Using Conventional Commits
			yargs: everyone’s favorite pirate themed command line argument parser.
			parse-commit-message: Spec compliant parsing utility to get object like { header: { type, scope, subject }, body, footer } from given commit message string.
